# Brief Introduction About Myself
Hello! My name is Mudatinya Charles. I am currently learning GitHub as part of my journey into software development and version control. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building practical solutions.
Outside of tech, I love reading, collaborating with others, and continuously learning new things. Iâ€™m excited to apply what I learn here to future coding projects.
